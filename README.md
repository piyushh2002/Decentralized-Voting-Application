Decentralized Voting Application

Welcome to the Decentralized Voting Application! This project demonstrates how to implement voting using Solidity smart contracts and ReactJS. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, security, and immutability in the voting process.

Features
Decentralized Voting:
Users can cast their votes securely on the Ethereum blockchain.
Each vote is recorded as a transaction, making it tamper-proof and transparent.
MetaMask Integration:
Weâ€™ve integrated MetaMask for seamless user authentication.
Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to participate in the voting process.
Real-Time Notifications:
Discord is used for real-time notifications and interactions.
Users receive updates on voting results and other relevant information.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the application:

Clone the repository:
Download the project

Install dependencies:
npm install

Compile and deploy the smart contract:
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run --network volta scripts/deploy.js

Update environment variables:
Copy the contract address and paste it in the .env file.
Specify the blockchain endpoint (if using a different network) in hardhat-config.js.
Start the application:
npm start
